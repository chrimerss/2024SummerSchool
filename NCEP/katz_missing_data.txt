--------
6 Feb and 26 Feb data are missing.

Aug 2012
--------
We didn't receive 6-hourly analysis from OHRFC during that time: see
http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/SREF/pcpanl/stage4/problems.log. What's
in the CODIAC archive is the final version of the Stage IV.

The NCEP Stage II is made from the gauge and radar reports received
directly at NCEP, that's why it's not affected by the datastream from
OHRFC. Additional info: http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/SREF/pcpanl/.

ST4.2009100312.24h is missing

Dec 2008
--------
Beginning 12/1/2008, we are no longer downloading ceopgfs* files. Those files
were for the CEOP project and there has been a change in the format for 
CEOP phase 2.  Once that is finalized, we will begin downloading files again.
It may be a month or more before they are ready. 

Nov 2008
--------
There were no Stage II/IV files at all for 2 Nov, and a number of
files were missing from 1 and 3 Nov.  There was a problem at CBRFC -
they started sending us what appeared to be forecasts 2-3 days into the
future, which caused some problems in our Stage IV mosaic processing
since it was set up to handle only 'past' analysis files.  The problem
was fixed on 4 Nov but the lost files are lost for good. 

May 2008
--------
The ceopgfs* files for 5-may through 11-may are missing. Confirmed
unrecoverable with Sid.

6-may hrly precip data is small due to hardware problems.
16-may may also have smaller than normal number of reports.

even though it was not listed in the stage4 readme files, the inclusion of
'rfc8' files in the ST2_4km.$yyyymmdd was stopped on 31-may-2008.  there
are only 2 files being dropped.

the ftp site.  Sid Katz was emailed.

------------
Could not download file: ceopgfs.2006100812
Could not download file: ceopgfs.2006100900
Could not download file: ceopgfs.2006100912

In my note for the Aug 2006 data download, I mentioned that NCEP is suspending the 
archiving of those data files until the next phase of CEOP in early 2007.  So, 
whenever there is a glitch in the daily scheduled run that creates the ceopgfs... 
files, they can go missing if I don't act quickly.  Those date in Oct appear to be 
the dates when the operational system was moved to the backup system for a couple 
of days. - Sid

7/11/06 - Added a dummy file (all values set to missing) ceopgfs.2006040412
to ceopavn.200604.tar.  The file is missing because of operational errors
and is unrecoverable. Have added this file in order to have an
uninterrupted stream of files.

Hi Janine,

Ying noticed that the small file occurred during a time when there were
other possible problems.  She reran the stage II/IV jobs for the 15-23
March.  I have recreated the stage4.mar2006 file.  There are revised files
for the 15-23 March days, so you should update the Codiac archive with
these files.

Thanks for identifying this instance.

Sid....
